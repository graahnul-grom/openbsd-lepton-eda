[Lepton EDA](https://github.com/lepton-eda/lepton-eda)
is a suite of free software tools for designing electronics,
an actively developed fork of the
[gEDA/gaf suite](http://www.geda-project.org),
started in late 2016 by most of gEDA/gaf developers at that time.
It's backward compatible with its predecessor and
supports the same file format for symbols and schematics.
